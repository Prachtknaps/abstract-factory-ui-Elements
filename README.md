# Abstract Factory - UI Elements Example

## Important
Please don't hate me for not integrating Linux into this project! Linux is a fantastic operating system, but I wanted to keep this demonstration of the Abstract Factory design pattern as simple as possible. :D

## Project Structure
The main logic of this project can be found in the `Main.java` file. This is where the application determines the operating system and chooses the appropriate factory to instantiate the UI components.
